# Mobile Intern Test - Address Search App 📱

This Android application was developed as part of a mobile intern test. It provides address search functionality using the LocationIQ API and allows users to get directions to selected locations via Google Maps.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- 🔍 **Address Search**: Search for locations using LocationIQ API
- 📋 **Search Results Display**: Shows a list of matching locations
- 🗺️ **Google Maps Integration**: Tapping a result opens directions in Google Maps from current location to destination
- ✨ **Highlighted Search Keywords**: Search terms are highlighted in the results
- ⏳ **Debounced Search**: 1-second debounce on search input to prevent excessive API calls

### Technical Implementation

- 🏗️ **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of UI, business logic, and data
- 🧩 **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data sources for better testability
- 🔄 **LiveData & Coroutines**: Reactive UI updates and asynchronous operations
- 🌐 **Retrofit**: Type-safe HTTP client for API communication
- 📍 **Location Services**: Integration with device location for directions

## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

- **View Layer**: Activities and Adapters
- **ViewModel Layer**: AddressSearchViewModel
- **Model Layer**: Repository and API Services

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Replace the LocationIQ API key in `LocationRepository.kt` with your own key
3. Replace the Google Maps API key in `AndroidManifest.xml` and `MainActivity.kt` with your own key
4. Build and run the application

## API Keys

The application requires two API keys:

1. **LocationIQ API Key**: For address search functionality

   - Get it from: https://locationiq.com/

2. **Google Maps API Key**: For directions functionality
   - Get it from: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key
